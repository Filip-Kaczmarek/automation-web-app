# automation-web-app
A web application using python with dash framework to simulate the work of a water flow heater.

The app allows user to insert parameters of a flow heater and simulate its work in a given period of time. There are two seperate input blocks that allow to compare two flow heaters side by side. Below the input blocks there is an area for four different plots, which show the heater and water parameters depending on time. All of the input fields have limited values and provide error handling.
